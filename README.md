# Dicey-Dice-Roller
Dicey Dice Roller is a basic Vue.js web app. It will roll an amount of dice and show all each value. There is also an option to give the sum of the rolled dice. This uses the Fisherâ€“Yates randomizer (I sense a theme here) to randomize an array of numbers based on the die type. Then the roller picks a number from the middle of the array to minimize the bias. After learning some basics of JS I wanted to learn about different frameworks and chose Vue.js.
